This project started out as a quick website being built using a static HTML file. But as I came up with new features I decided to make it more dynamic using PHP and JS. Since this has been a side project done in a couple of hours, no great time was spent using best or coolest code practices.

## Adding activities
1. Take a screen shot of the map on the phone
2. Open in PS and crop to 1125x1125
3. Resize to 500x500
4. Export as PNG
5. Upload to https://derivv.com/ to make additional sizes 50x50, 100x100, 200x200, 300x300 and 400x400
6. Create sizes and download zip
7. Unzip and upload to TinyPNG
8. Upload 500x500 version to TinyPNG
9. Download zip from TinyPNG
10. Add to correct project folder
11. Rename resized images by removing underscores
12. Make the activity public
13. Copy the iFrame code
14. Make the activity private
15. Set the ids for the activity in the "database"
16. Set the distance for the activity

## Releaseplan
1. Name all activities by the letter it represents
2. Get screenshot of each activity to use as letter image
3. Set the distance of each activity in the data file
4. Set the activity ids of each activity in the data file
5. Test locally
6. Make activities public
7. Test locally
8. Upload everything to the server
